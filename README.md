# Blogging with N8N

A comprehensive AI-powered blogging automation system built with N8N that creates, optimizes, and publishes high-quality blog content automatically.

## Project Objective

This project demonstrates a complete automated blogging workflow that transforms a simple topic request into a fully published, SEO-optimized blog post. The system uses multiple specialized AI agents working in sequence to handle every aspect of content creation, from initial research to final publication on your Ghost CMS website.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Model Selection

**Use high token per minute (TPM) models for optimal performance.** The interactions between multiple AI agents will quickly surpass the 30k TPM limit of most standard models. We recommend starting with **ChatGPT 5-mini** which offers a 200k TPM limit, or other high-TPM models to ensure smooth workflow execution without rate limiting interruptions.

### Model Comparison Table

| Model | Token limits | Request and other limits | Batch queue limits |
|-------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| gpt-5 | 30,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 900,000 TPD |
| gpt-5-mini | 200,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 2,000,000 TPD |
| gpt-5-nano | 200,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 2,000,000 TPD |
| gpt-4.1 | 30,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 900,000 TPD |
| gpt-4.1-mini | 200,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 2,000,000 TPD |
| gpt-4.1-nano | 200,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 2,000,000 TPD |
| o3 | 30,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 90,000 TPD |
| o4-mini | 200,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 2,000,000 TPD |
| gpt-4o | 30,000 TPM | 500 RPM | 90,000 TPD |

**Key Abbreviations:**
- **TPM**: Tokens Per Minute
- **RPM**: Requests Per Minute  
- **TPD**: Tokens Per Day

### Anthropic Claude Models (Tier 1)

| Model | Maximum requests per minute (RPM) | Maximum input tokens per minute (ITPM) | Maximum output tokens per minute (OTPM) |
|-------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Claude Opus 4.x* | 50 | 30,000 | 8,000 |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | 50 | 30,000 | 8,000 |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 | 50 | 20,000 | 8,000 |
| Claude Sonnet 3.5<br>2024-10-22 (deprecated) | 50 | 40,000‚Ä† | 8,000 |
| Claude Sonnet 3.5<br>2024-06-20 (deprecated) | 50 | 40,000‚Ä† | 8,000 |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | 50 | 50,000‚Ä† | 10,000 |
| Claude Opus 3 (deprecated) | 50 | 20,000‚Ä† | 4,000 |
| Claude Haiku 3 | 50 | 50,000‚Ä† | 10,000 |

**Notes:**
- *Claude Opus 4.x models are currently in limited access
- ‚Ä†These models have higher input token limits but are deprecated

## How It Works

The workflow orchestrates a team of AI agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of content creation. Starting with a user's topic request, the system automatically:
1. **Researches** the topic comprehensively
2. **Creates** a structured table of contents
3. **Generates** engaging, well-researched content
4. **Optimizes** for SEO and search visibility
5. **Edits** and polishes the content
6. **Publishes** directly to your Ghost CMS website

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### ü§ñ Blog Content Orchestrator Agent
**The Project Manager** - Coordinates the entire workflow, manages data flow between agents, and ensures quality control at each stage. This agent handles user interactions, validates data, and manages approval gates before proceeding to publication.

### üîç Research Agent
**The Information Specialist** - Conducts comprehensive research using multiple sources including Brave Search, Brave News, and your existing blog content. Creates compelling table of contents, identifies content gaps, and provides research insights for content generation.
